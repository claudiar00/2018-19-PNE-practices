Session 11 notes

By default, web's port is 80
The way of communication between web servers and web browser is HTTP, and its necessary to use a GET/ (a petition),
which is known as request line.
In this case, the client will be the web browser, while the web server is the server.
The name of each data is called URL and when we write it down in the browser, we are requesting a web page from the
server.
The content-type tells what type of message is going to be send (i.e. Content-type: text/html), and below the content
type it appears an html code for creating a web page (doctype html)

as a response we should receive a status line with content type and content length.
Its necessary to always put \r\n after a line of code
